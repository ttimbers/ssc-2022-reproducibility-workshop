## SSC 2022 Reproducibility Workshop

### Local Installation

Before the workshop, if you want to work on your own computer and your own
file system, you should complete the following steps.

1. Update your version of R locally to at least 4.0, preferably [4.2.0](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2. Update your version of RStudio locally to at least 2022.02, to match
the flow we will show.
3. Install Git locally ([Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/); [Mac](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-xcode-command-line-tools/)).

Regardless of whether you will work locally, or on the provided server
environment, you will need to register for a GitHub account (below).

### Server Environment

An account has been created for you on Wesley's RStudio Workbench/Server,
as ses hyphen first initial + last name (e.g., ses-wburr). The password
for all accounts has been set to the password provided to you
via the contact email. If you login to the
provided URL, you will be presented with the RStudio interface, and you
can create a new project or configure your interface as we will discuss
during the workshop.

### Either Way ... 

4. Register for a GitHub account. This is intended as a **professional**
account, so consider [reading this guide](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)
to help with account name selection and details on account types.

## And Now You're Ready

You've updated RStudio and R (or are using the server), have a GitHub account, 
and you're ready for us to help you set up the later stages.
